# Bitcoin Accounting

This app will in the future be a one stop shop for accounting for your
coinbase account. So you can track your bitcoin spending over time!
It does this by tracking all your trades on coinbase, and 'accounting'
them if you ever withdraw EUR.

## Getting Started

All the fun code can be found in lib/main.dart. lib/coinbase_accounts.dart
is auto generated json code that doesn't work. So it's really not that exciting.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
